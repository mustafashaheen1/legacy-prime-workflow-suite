    tip: "Did you know? According to the International Building Code, kitchen counter height is 36 inches maximum. This ensures accessibility and comfort for most users.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    category: "Building Codes",
    tip: "Standard residential door width is 36 inches, but accessible entrances require a minimum clear width of 32 inches when the door is open at 90 degrees.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: "Building Codes",
    tip: "Stairway handrails must be between 34-38 inches high, measured vertically from the stair nosing. This provides optimal safety for most users.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: "Building Codes",
    tip: "Ceiling height in habitable rooms must be at least 7 feet, but bathrooms and kitchens can have a minimum of 6 feet 8 inches.",

    category: "Safety",
    tip: "Always install GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets within 6 feet of any water source - this can prevent fatal electrical shocks.",

    category: "Safety",
    tip: "Smoke detectors should be installed on every level of a home, inside bedrooms, and outside sleeping areas. Test them monthly!",

    id: 7,
    category: "Framing",
    tip: "Standard wall stud spacing is 16 inches on center. This spacing provides adequate support and works well with standard 4x8 sheet materials.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    category: "Framing",
    tip: "A load-bearing wall typically has doubled top plates. Never remove or modify without consulting a structural engineer!",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    category: "Concrete",
    tip: "Concrete reaches about 70% of its strength in 7 days and continues curing for up to 28 days. Patience pays off for structural integrity!",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    category: "Concrete",
    tip: "The ideal concrete mix ratio is 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts gravel. Too much water weakens the final product.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    category: "Roofing",
    tip: "A 4/12 roof pitch means the roof rises 4 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal run. Minimum pitch for shingle roofs is typically 2/12.",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: "Roofing",
    tip: "Asphalt shingles last 15-30 years, metal roofs 40-70 years, and slate can last over 100 years. Choose based on your budget and long-term plans.",
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: "Plumbing",
    tip: "All drain lines must have a minimum slope of 1/4 inch per foot to ensure proper drainage and prevent clogs.",
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    category: "Plumbing",
    tip: "A P-trap under sinks prevents sewer gases from entering your home. The trap should always have water in it to maintain the seal.",
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    category: "Electrical",
    tip: "Standard receptacles should be no more than 12 feet apart on a wall. This ensures you always have convenient access to power.",
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: "Electrical",
    tip: "Use 14-gauge wire for 15-amp circuits and 12-gauge for 20-amp circuits. Never mix wire gauges on the same circuit!",
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    category: "Insulation",
    tip: "R-value measures insulation effectiveness. Higher is better! Attics typically need R-38 to R-60 depending on your climate zone.",
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    category: "Insulation",
    tip: "Air sealing is just as important as insulation. A home with gaps but great insulation can lose as much heat as one with poor insulation!",
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    category: "Windows",
    tip: "Window headers must support the load above. A 4-foot span typically requires a double 2x6 header in non-load-bearing walls.",
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    category: "Windows",
    tip: "Install windows with a slight outward tilt at the top (3/16 inch) to ensure proper water drainage and prevent leaks.",
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    category: "Flooring",
    tip: "Hardwood flooring needs an expansion gap of 1/2 to 3/4 inch around all walls. Wood expands and contracts with humidity changes!",
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    category: "Flooring",
    tip: "Tile installation requires proper substrate. Use cement board for wet areas - regular drywall will fail in moisture-prone locations.",
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    category: "HVAC",
    tip: "A properly sized HVAC system is crucial. Oversizing wastes energy and causes humidity problems; undersizing won't heat/cool adequately.",
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    category: "HVAC",
    tip: "Change HVAC filters every 1-3 months. A dirty filter reduces efficiency by up to 15% and can damage your system.",
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    category: "Foundation",
    tip: "Foundation footings must extend below the frost line to prevent heaving. The frost line depth varies by climate - check your local codes!",
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    category: "Foundation",
    tip: "Proper drainage around foundations is critical. Grade soil away from the house at 6 inches for the first 10 feet to prevent water intrusion.",
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    category: "Drywall",
    tip: "Drywall screws should be spaced 12 inches apart on ceilings and 16 inches on walls. Dimple the screws slightly without breaking the paper.",
  },
  {
    id: 28,
    category: "Drywall",
    tip: "Apply drywall compound in thin coats. Three thin coats sand easier and look better than one thick coat. Patience is key!",
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    category: "Painting",
    tip: "Paint in temperatures between 50-85°F for best results. Extreme temperatures affect drying time and final finish quality.",
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    category: "Painting",
    tip: "Primer is essential! It helps paint adhere better, provides uniform coverage, and can save you money by reducing the number of top coats needed.",
  },
  {
    id: 31,
    category: "Measurements",
    tip: "The 3-4-5 triangle rule ensures square corners: measure 3 feet on one side, 4 feet on another - the diagonal should be exactly 5 feet.",
  },
  {
    id: 32,
    category: "Measurements",
    tip: "Measure twice, cut once! But also add 1/16 inch to measurements for tight-fitting trim - it's easier to sand down than add material.",
  },
  {
    id: 33,
    category: "Budget",
    tip: "Plan for 10-20% contingency in your construction budget. Unexpected issues are normal - better to have funds ready than scramble later.",
  },
  {
    id: 34,
    category: "Budget",
    tip: "Material costs typically account for 40-50% of total project cost, labor 20-30%, and overhead/profit 20-30%. Use this to estimate projects.",
  },
  {
    id: 35,
    category: "Tools",
    tip: "Keep your tools sharp! A sharp saw blade or chisel is safer and gives cleaner cuts than a dull one. Sharpen or replace regularly.",
  },
  {
    id: 36,
    category: "Tools",
    tip: "Invest in a quality level and square. These basic tools ensure accuracy - cheap ones can throw off entire projects!",
  },
  {
    id: 37,
    category: "Weather",
    tip: "Don't pour concrete when temperatures will drop below 40°F within 24 hours. Cold weather significantly slows curing and reduces strength.",
  },
  {
    id: 38,
    category: "Weather",
    tip: "Install roofing during dry, warm weather (60-80°F). Shingles seal better and are less likely to crack during installation.",
  },
  {
    id: 39,
    category: "Permits",
    tip: "Always check if you need a permit before starting work. Unpermitted work can affect home sales and may need to be torn out and redone.",
  },
  {
    id: 40,
    category: "Permits",
    tip: "Keep all permits and inspection records. Future buyers will want to see documentation of major work completed on the property.",
